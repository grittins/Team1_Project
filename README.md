## Project Overview: Predicting Toronto House Prices
Our project aims at predicting Toronto house prices. We've chosen that topic as our group was interested in making a market analysis and the house market does impact everyone. 

- **Presentation:** 
- **GitHub:** Our Github Team1_Project will include commits and branches from all team members.
- **Machine Learning Model:** The ML Decision FlowChart.png indicates how we decided to go with an unstructured ML, using sklearn linear model for price prediction.
- **Database:** We'll be using PostGreSQL for our database.
- **Dashboard:** We're still debating on how to tackle that part of the assignment. We'll most likely be doing some visualizations using Tableau. 

## Resources 
- We'll be using TREB sold data.
- sc2.py was used to scrape treb site for pdfs. 
- ML Analasis FlowChart.png
- ML Decision FlowChart.png
- Target Variable Details and Data Structure.xlsx - excel sheet with info on which price series we'll include for forecasting, some data samples from the raw extracts from treb pdf files.
- DataProcessing_ExcelVBA - draft of vba macro to start understanding how excel files are structured and how we might begin to automate processing. only works for midpoint pdf version at the moment.


Linear Regression approach will be modelled for the factors effecting house prices. For the model, the following X-variables will be taken into account. 
- Time Period 
- House-Type 
- Location 
- Interest Rates
- Inflation Rate
- Recession Period

A simple database diagram is sketched for the initial understanding of how the datapoints are connected. A further reiteration is expected.
