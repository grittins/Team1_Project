# Team 1 Final Project 
## Project Overview: Predicting Toronto House Prices
Our project aims at predicting Toronto house prices. We've chosen that topic as our group was interested in making a market analysis and the house market does impact everyone. 

- **Presentation:** 
- **GitHub:** Our Github Team1_Project will include commits and branches from all team members.
- **Machine Learning Model:** The ML Decision FlowChart.png indicates how we decided to go with an unstructured ML, using sklearn linear model for price prediction.
- **Database:** We'll be using PostGreSQL for our database.
- **Dashboard:** We're still debating on how to tackle that part of the assignment. We'll most likely be doing some visualizations using Tableau. 

## Resources 
- We'll be using TREB sold data.
- sc2.py was used to scrape treb site for pdfs. 
- ML Analasis FlowChart.png
- ML Decision FlowChart.png
- Target Variable Details and Data Structure.xlsx - excel sheet with info on which price series we'll include for forecasting, some data samples from the raw extracts from treb pdf files.
- DataProcessing_ExcelVBA - draft of vba macro to start understanding how excel files are structured and how we might begin to automate processing. only works for midpoint pdf version at the moment.
